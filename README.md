### Hello World, WELCOME to my Github Page ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m constantly working on myself, to improve, in terms of critical thinking, health and building relationships 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I can, focussing on data science, technology and the financial markets

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to expand my knowledge on computer science, data, software engineering and finance 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with focus, attention and mental well-being 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experiences, I would be glad to share. Yet I believe the future is more to hold. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn, Medium, Twitter, Instagram, Email 

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/ him/ his 

âš¡ Fun fact: I adore dogs, and hopefully finally can have a samoyed when I settle down (but not feasible in the tropics?)
